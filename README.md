### About

Smooth is an app created to visualize your perfect day, according to you, ideated and executed by, Bilal, Brandon, Christian, Deric, and Vamshi. Using crowd sourced activities, users can narrow down choices by location to find the one that fit their time and spending criteria. Smooth is built with MERN stack in a collaborative one week sprint.

### Technologies and Libraries

Smooth is a full-stack web application that is built on MERN. The backend of the application is built using Node.js, Express, and MongoDB. Node.js is a popular server-side JavaScript runtime environment that is used to execute server-side code. Express is a lightweight and flexible Node.js web application framework that provides a set of features for web and mobile applications. MongoDB is a NoSQL database that is designed for scalability, performance, and ease of use.

On the frontend, the application is built using React.js and Redux. React.js is a JavaScript library that is used for building user interfaces and is known for its performance and scalability. Redux is a predictable state container that helps manage the state of the application.

In addition to the core technologies, we are also using several libraries to enhance the functionality and user experience of the application. These include Dnd JS for drag-and-drop functionality, Chart JS for chart visualization, Swiper JS for image sliders, and Google Maps API for location-based services.

Overall, the MERN stack provides a robust and scalable foundation for building modern web applications that can handle a large volume of traffic and data. The combination of Node.js, Express, MongoDB, React.js, and Redux, along with additional libraries, allows us to build a feature-rich and responsive application that meets the needs of our users.
